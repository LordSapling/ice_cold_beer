# Ice Cold Beer

### Overview 
Ice Cold Beer is a single player, third person arcade game for PC

### Objective 
The player must maneuver a ball into the lit up hole on the screen using a rod.

### Gameplay
The player can only adjust the position of the two ends of the rod. The postion of the rod can only be moved up or down in order to create a type of slope for the ball in the center of the rod to roll on. This will allow movement and the ability to maneuver the ball into the required hole.

### Player Character 
The player chatacter is simply just the rod. Which will try to assist the ball in moving into the correct hole when instrcuted to do so.

### Main Features 
1. The movement is controlled by adjusting the two ends of the rod either up or down to create a slop for the ball to move on.
2. The player's health could be some kind of number, allowing the player to make 3 mistakes before the game round ends for them.
3. Scoring is simply just a increasing number by 1 for every ball put into the correct hole.
4. The progression of the game is by the score the player has, the higher the score the more difficult of a location is required to put the ball into. There is no end to this game, just try to get as many points as you can.
5. The main obstacles of this game is the other holes. If a player puts the ball into the wrong hole, the player will lose 1 health point.
6. One item in this game could be some kind of power up that is already given at the start to the player. This power up could help cover some holes in order to make your task to get the ball in the right hole easier.
7. As of now, there is no special features in this game.

### Note to Self
9-26-2019
On this day we made a physical prototype of the game. We need to create the "doo dads" that move the ramp up and down with player imput. Step 1 is to make one first. We know we are using mouse and keyboard, so no matterwhta platform we ultamilty release the game we have to have a way to control it on the computer. We need to make a control so we can test the game.
Commonly games use "wasd" or the arrows keys, so maybe "w" is up, and "s" is down, for arrows, up is up, down is down, for a mouse, left and right click could also work. 
In the interest of moving on quickly, we are just going to use "wasd" and arrow keys.

### Assets of Interest
Theme: Space/Sky
1. Background: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/starfield-skybox-92717 : A outerspace like background.
2. Ball: https://stealthix.itch.io/animated-fires : A comet looking ball.
3. Walls: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/world-materials-free-150182 : One of these could be the walls maybe even the ramp as well.
4. Ramp: https://yonkousama.itch.io/vector-planets : Could use one of the comets on here as a ramp, just need to stretch it out.
5. "Holes": https://yonkousama.itch.io/vector-planets : Some planets maybe your "comet" could "visit".

### Sound Design Possibilities
1. Background: https://freesound.org/people/levelclearer/sounds/238558/ : A nice background that could work for both a sky or like space like feeling. Might need a cut at the end so it sounds like it didn't end every loop.
2. Goal Victory: https://freesound.org/people/xtrgamr/sounds/277441/ : I suppose this one could work for a victory.
3. Wall Bump: https://freesound.org/people/Raclure/sounds/483602/ : When bumping into a wall, maybe this one could work.
4. Ball Rolling Sound?: https://freesound.org/people/SquirmTheVerm/sounds/260778/ : Just an idea, could be better for a sound of a ball rolling around, placeholder perhaps.
